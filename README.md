**TFT Class for a TFT with SSD1963 controller**

#Description and physical interface#

A Python class for controlling a graphical display with a SSD1963 controller and a 40 PIN interface, which is widely available in the electronics stores. It is a port of the great UTFT driver from Rinky-Dink Electronics, Henning Karlsen. This port uses at least 11 control lines for the 8080-type interface style:

- X1..X8 for data
- Y9 for /Reset
- Y10 for /RD
- Y11 for /WR
- Y12 for C/D

If you only write to the display's frame buffer, RD (Y10) may be left open, but then the transparency modes of printChar() do not work any more. Optionally, the follwing lines can be used:

- X3 for LED
- X4 for TFT POWER

CS of the TFT must be tied to GND. A separate supply for the TFT's Vcc should be set up, since it may consume more power than the Pyboard can supply. But it is fine to connect the input of the power regulator to PyBoard Vin, unless the TFT sips more than 1A. Then you can supply the whole unit either through USB or an external power supply at Vin and GND. Before using X3 for LED, check the schematics of the display. In the version I have LED is the enable input of the LED power's step-up converter. But the LED input may be as well the LED power input itself, in which case you have to supply the appropriate current & voltage. If you do not use X3 for LED, connect LED to the 3.3Vcc of the TFT. 
LED may also be controlled by one the SSD1963's GPIO's. But that requires resoldering a resistor on the TFT and changing the setting of the SSD1963.

At the moment, the code is a basic package. I have a two TFTs here, so I cannot test a lot. The actual state is working with a 480x272 and a 800x480 TFT in landscape and portrait mode. There is no principal limitation in size and mode, as long as the 1215k frame buffer of the SSD1963 fits. I just have to figure out how to set the TFT's configuration and make a smooth interface for that.

Since the number of port lines on Pyboard is limited, I use the 8 bit interface. With X1 to x8, these are nicely available at GPIO port A0..A7 in the right order - intentionally, I assume. For speed, the lower level functions are coded as viper or assembler functions. Obviously, the Assembler versions are little bit faster, at the cost of LOC. The total advantage of using assembler may be limited. The assembler functions need 220ns to 260ns to send the three bytes of a display pixel, in contrast to the about 4 µs needed to call this function.
On the upside of this 8 bit interface choice is, that you can supply up to 24 bit of color data, in contrast to the 16 bit when using the 16 bit interface.

In total, the speed is reasonable. Clearing the 480x272 display (= filling it with a fixed color) takes about 25ms. Filling it with varying patterns takes about 40 ms. Reading a 480x272 sized bitmap from a file and showing it takes about 250 to 350ms, depending on the speed of the SD card, the same for a 800x480 bitmap takes 500 to 700ms. Most of that time is needed for reading the file. Drawing a horizontal or vertical line takes about 250µs. Since most of the time is needed for set-up of the function, the length of the line does not really matter. Drawing a single Pixel at a certain coordinate takes 9µs, in contrast to the 250ns/Pixel in bulk transfers, used e.g. by clearSCR() or fillRectangle().

#Class TFT#
##High level functions##

###Create instance:###

**mytft = TFT(controller, lcd_type, orientation [, flip_vertical = False][, flip_horizontal = False])**

* **controller**: String with the controller model. At the moment, "SSD1963" is the only one supported
* **lcd_type**: type of LCD. At the moment, "LB04301" (480x272, 4.3") and "AT070TN92" (800x480, 7") are supported.
* **orientation**: which is LANDSCAPE or PORTRAIT
* **flip_vertical**: Flip vertical True/False
+ **flip_horizontal**: Flip horizontal True/False

###Functions:###

**tft_init(controller, lcd_type, orientation [, flip_vertical = False][, flip_horizontal = False])**
repeat the initialization which was peformed during creation of the instance.  This function must be called if the TFT power was switched off, but PyBoard kept  on running. tft_init is called by __init__() during the creation of the instance. It includes the call to power(True), but leaves the backlight off!

**getScreensize():**
return a tuple of logical screen width and height

**setColor(FGcolor) **
Set the default foreground color, used by the draw functions. **FGcolor** must be a 3-element tuple with the values for red, green and blue. range 0..255 each; the lower bits may be ignored

**setBGColor(BGcolor)** 
Set the default background color, used by clrSCR() and other functions. **BGcolor** must be a 3-element tuple with the values for red, green and blue in the       range 0..255 each; the lower bits may be ignored.

**getColor()** 
Get the default foreground color, set by a previous setColor() call.

**getBGColor()** 
Get the default background color, set by a previous setBGColor() call.

**set_tft_mode([v_flip = False,][ h_flip = False,][ c_flip = False, ][orientation = LANDSCAPE])**
Set the operation mode of the tft, equivalent to the settings used at init time. Parameters:

* orientation: which is LANDSCAPE or PORTRAIT.
* v_flip: Flip vertical True/False
* h_flip: Flip horizontal True/False
* c_flip: exchange red/blue. This change is effecttive for the whole screen.
    
**get_tft_mode()**
Gets the 4 element tuple of v_flip, h_flip, c_flip and orientation.

**clrSCR([color = None)**
Set the total screen to the background color, set the scroll area back to the full screen and set the text print position to (0,0).

**drawLine(x1, y2, x2, y2 [, color = None])**
 Draw a line from x1, y1 to x2, y2. If the line is horizontal or vertical, 
the respective functions are used. Otherwise drawPixel is used. 
The optional parameter color specifies the color to be used for clearing. If not set the color specified by setColor() is taken.

**drawHLine(x, y, len [, color = None])**
Draw a horizontal line from x,y of len length. 
The optional parameter color specifies the color to be used for clearing. If not set the color specified by setColor() is taken.

**drawVLine(x, y, len [, color = None])**

**drawBitmap(x, y, width, height, data, bits [, colortable])**
Display a bitmap at location **x**, **y** and dimension **width** x **height**. **data** must contain the bitmap data and must be of type bytearray or buffer. **bits** tells how many bits per pixel the data must have:

* bits = 24 (default): The data must contain 3 bytes per pixel (red, green, blue),  which can for instance created by exporting 24 color-bit raw data files with gimp. The total size of data must be width * height * 3. 
* bits = 16: The data must contain 2 bytes per pixel with packed color data (rrrrrggggggbbb) in big endian format (the byte with red first). 
The total size of data must be width * height * 2. 
* bits = 1: The data must contain 1 bit per pixel. The colors to be use  must be supplied in the colortable, 4 bytes per value in the order

No type or size checking of the data is performed.

**setTextPos(x, y[, clip = 0][, scroll = True])**
Set the starting position for the following calls of  printString() and printChar() to **x**, **y.** x, y is the position of the leftside top pixel of the first character using the font given in font. **clip** defines, if set, the maximal length which will be printed. The default is the  screen width. **scroll** tells, whether text will flow over to a next line if longer than the screen width or the width given by clip. The default is True.
      
**getTextPos()**
Return a tuple with the actual x,y values of the text postion for the next char to be printed.

**setTextStyle(fgcolor = None [, bgcolor = None][, transparency = 0][, font = dummyfont][, gap = 0])**
Set the Style used for text printing with printChar() and printString().  If **fgcolor** is given, that color is used for the characters. If **bgcolor** is given, that color is used for the background. For transparency the following values are valid:

- 0: no transparency. The bgcolor is used for char. background, fgcolor for the text
- 1: 50% transparency. The previous background is 50% dimmed
- 2: full transparency. The previous background is kept.
- 4: the existing background will be inverted
- 8: for the foreground color, each background pixel value is inverted.
	
The foreground setting can be combined with any of the background settings. Default are colors set by setColor() and setBGColor(). 
**fgcolor** and **bgcolor** must be triples that can be converted to a 
bytearray, e.g. tuples, lists or strings. The font used must be created e.g. using the GLCD tool and then convert it using the cfonts_to_packed_py.py script of Peter Hinch, adapted to the needs of 
this library. **gap** is an additional spacing between the characters.

**getTextStyle()**
Return a tuple of fgcolor, bgcolot, transparency, font and gap.

**printString(s [, buffer])**
Print the string s at the location set by setTextPos() in the style 
      detailed by setTextStyle(). **buffer**  is a optional argument for a buffer receiving the background data when transparency is chosen. The size must be at least char_with * char_heigth * 3. There is no size checking involved. If the buffer is too small,  the program will crash. 
printStr advances the text position for the next text by the width of the character. It will flow over to a next line, if necessary and enabled by setTextPos(), at a distance given by the char height. Before printing text, the font must be set with setTextStyle()
      
**printChar(c [, buffer])**
Print the character **c** at the location set by setTextPos() in the style detailed by setTextStyle().
**buffer** is a optional argument for a buffer receiving the background data when transparency is chosen. The size must be at least char_with * char_heigth * 3. There is no size checking involved. If the buffer is too small, the program will crash. printChar advances the text position for the next text by the width of the character. It will flow over to a next line, if necessary and enabled by setTextPos(), at a distance given by the char height. Before printing text, the font must be set with setTextStyle().
      
**printNewline()**
Advance the string text position to the next line, where the line height is given by the selected font and clear this line.
    
**printCR()**
Set the text position to the start of the line.

**printClrSCR()**
Clear the scrollable window set by setScrollArea() with the background color set by setTextStyle(). The text position and the logical first line is set to the start of the physical first line of that area. 

**printClrLine(mode = 0)**
Clear to the actual line depedning on the value of the **mode** argument:
0: Clear to the end of the line 
1: Clear to the beginning of the line 
2: Clear the entire line 
The text background color and the height given by the selected font.

**setScrollArea(top_fixed_area,  vertical_scroll_area, bottom_fixed_area)**
Define the area for line scrolling.  **top_fixed_area** tells the number of lines at the top which are not scrolled, **vertical_scroll_area**: the number of lines which will be scrolled, and **bottom_fixed_area** the number of lines at the bottom which are not scrolled.

**setScrollStart(line)**
Set the line which will be the one display first in the vertical scroll area.  **line**  is the first logical line displayed in the scroll area.
Screen coordinates are always physical coordinates. 

           
## Lower level functions ##

**setXY(x1, y1, x2, y2)**
Set the region for the bulk transfer functions fillSCR() and displaySCRxx()
    
**clrXY()**
Set the bulk transfer region back to the full screen size.
    
**TFT_io.fillSCR_AS(data, size)**
Fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel value given
in **data**. **size** is the number of pixels, **data** must be a bytearray object of three bytes length with the red-green-blue values.
          
**TFT_io.displaySCR_AS(data, size)**
Fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel values given
in **data**. **size** is the number of pixels, **data** must be a bytearray object of 3 * size length with the red-green-blue values per pixel.
    
**TFT_io.displaySCR565_AS(data, size)**
Fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel values given
 in data. **size** is the number of pixels, **data** must be a bytearray object of 2 * size length with the 16 bit packed red-green-blue values per pixel. The color pattern per word is rrrrrggggggbbbbb, with rrrrr in the lower (=first) byte. 
          
**TFT_io.displaySCR_fontbitmap(bitmap: ptr8, size: int, control: ptr8, bg_buf: ptr8)**
Fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel values given
in bitmap. **bitmap** contains a single bit per pixel . The highest order bit in a byte is the first to be displayed. **size** is the number of bits the bitmap. **control** is a byte vector with further parameters controlling the behavior, packed here,  since viper functions allow 4 arguments only.

Byte 0..2: Background color, which is used for a bit value of 1
Byte 3..5: Foreground color, which is used for a bit value of 0
Byte 6: Transparency mode. See setTextStyle for the value definition

**bg_buf** must contain the frame buffer data for the pixel area chose. It is used only when the respective transparency mode is choses. If not used, an empty bytearray must be supllied. No size checking is performed. 
          
**TFT_io.displaySCR_bmp(bitmap: ptr8, size: int, bits: ptr8, colortable: ptr8)**
Fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel values given
in **bitmap**. The number of bits per pixel is defined by **bits**. Suitable values are 1, 2, 4, and 8. **size** tells the number of pixel data items in bitmap. **colortable** must contain the color matching to the respective value of a pixel with 4 bytes per value in the order blue, green, red, d/c. The fourth byte is ignored. Therefore, the expected size of colortable is 8, 16, 64 or 1024 bytes. No size checking is performed on bitmap or colortable.
          
**TFT_io.tft_cmd_data(cmd, data, size)**
**TFT_io.tft_cmd_data_AS(cmd, data, size)**
 Send a command byte and data to the controller. **cmd** is a single integer with the command, **data** a bytearray of size length with the command payload. The version with the AS suffix uses inline-assembler. During start-up of the TFT, when the device is clocked by the 10MHz or  6.5 MHz crystal, the assembler version is a little bit too fast. Please use the viper version instead. 
 This function may also be used for other displays like the Character based 2x20 or 4x20 displays, which use the 8080-type interface.

**TFT_io.tft_cmd(cmd)**
Send a single command byte to the TFT.
      
**TFT_io.tft_data_AS(cmd, data, size)**
Send data to the TFT. **size** is the number of bytes, **data** must be a bytearray object of **size** length.

**TFT_io.tft_read_cmd_data_AS(cmd, data, size)**
Send a command to the TFT and get the response back. **cmd** is the command byte, **data** a bytearray of **size** length which will receive the data. This function can be used to read status data or to read data from the frame buffer. In the latter case, the region to be read from must be specified first with a call to setXY().
      
#Class TFTfont#
Fonts used by the TFT lib are instances of a class. They are created in two steps:

1. Use GLCD font converter of MicroElectronica [http://www.mikroe.com/glcd-font-creator/](http://www.mikroe.com/glcd-font-creator/) to convert an ttf or otf font into a C data file. Take care to export the C variant. The free version may not allow to store the file directly. Then make use of the option 'copy to Clipboard'. By default, the character values 32 to 127 are converted. You may extend that. There is a bug in the tool when you start at char 0. Then, only the first char will be exported. If you like to include 0, you have to do two steps and combine the output manually.

2.  Use the script cfont_to_packed_py.py to convert the C-file ouput of GLCD into a python script, containing the font class, e.g.
```./cfont_to_packed_py.py font12.c -o font12.py```. If your character set does not start with the space character, you have to add another argument to the creation of the instance, which is the ordinal value of the first char in the font.

The resulting python file can be imported to your code, defining font names, e.g.
```from font12 import font12```
The font class exports three functions:

**TFTfont(fontbitmap, index, vert, hor, no_of_chars [, first_char=32])**
This creates the instance of the font. Parameters are:

* **fontbitmap**:  the data array with the pixel data
* **index**: an index array with the offsets of the character bitmaps to the start of the array
* **vert**: the vertical size of the font in pxels
* **hor**: the largest horizontal size of the font in pixels. For proportionally spaced fonts this value may differ for every characters
* **no_of_chars**: the number of characters defined in this font
* **first_char**: the ordinal value of the first characted in the font. Default is 32 (Space)
    
**get_char(c)**
Return the character bitmap and dimensions. **c** is the ordinal value of the character. The return value is a tuple comprising of:

* **bitmap**: The address of a packed bitmap defining character pixels column-by-column. Taken as Python object, this is an int, to be seen by a viper or 
assembler function as a ptr8 data type.
* **vert**: The vertical size of the character
* **hor**:  the horizontal size of the character

The total number of bits in the character bitmap is n = vert*hor.
    
**get_properties()**
Return a tuple with the basi properties of the font. These are:

 - **bits_vert**: the number of vertical pixels
 - **bits_hor**: the largest number of horizontal pixels. For monospaced fonts, this applies to all characters
 - **nchar**: the number of characters in the font set
 - **firstchar**: the ordinal number of the first character in the font set

#Remarks#
**To Do**
- Cleaning up the code

**Things beyond the horizon at the moment**
- Try other display sizes than 480x272 and 800x480
- Other Controllers

#Short Version History#

**0.1** Initial Release
Initial release with some basic functions, limited to a 480x272 display in landscape mode and PyBoard. More a proof of feasibilty.

**0.2** Portrait and Landscape mode

- Established PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE mode. 
- Added printString(), drawCircle() and fillCircle()

**0.3** Added more functions

- Font widths do not have to be a multiple of 8 any more. 
- Added drawCantedRectangle() and fillCantedrectangle(). 
- Changed the arguments of the constructor to name the controller and lcd type instead of controller and dimensions. The lcd type defines the size, the default orientation and the required initialization code. 
- Provided a dummy font.

**0.4** (no real changes to the TFT class)

- Some explanations on how to determine the LCD settings of the SSD1963 from the LCD data sheet, embedded in the source file.
- The graphic file conversion for displaying as a RGB data bitmap is nicely done by Gimp, the Swiss Army Knife of graphics. Just export the picture as raw data!

**0.5** Split up files

- Split up the class files and the font files
- Some testing and fixing of little bugs
- Changed the byte order in drawBitmap_565(), displaySCR565 and displaySCR565_AS. Now it is consistent to the bmp 65k color file type.

**0.6** Changed to the PCB Layout and Backlight

- added two functions to switch BG LED and power on/off, just to encapsulate these.
- added two variants of the PCB sketches. The 3rd variant uses a pair of transistors to switch the power
on and off, instead of the special power regulator which seems hard to get.
- moved the connection to the touchpad to other ports, such that both UART1 and SPI2 stay available.

**0.7** Changed text printing and font handling completely, with the kind cooperation of Peter Hinch

- changed the text print method, which requires now three functions calls, setTextStyle(), setTextPos() 
and printString() or printChar()
- changed backlight(on/off) to backlight(brightness)
- some minor changes to the interface PCB layout 

**0.8** Added some functions for a scrollable and fixed area and some more text print support

- added getTextStyle, printClrLine(), printClrSCR(), printCR(), printNewline()
- improved the speed of drawPixel() and setXY()
- some minor changes to the interface PCB layout

**0.9** Optional color parameter to all drawing functions

- Optional color parameter to all drawing functions
- Support of 1, 4 and 8 bit color depth of bmp data.
- changed getTextStyle() such that is matches setTextStyle()
