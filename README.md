**TFT Class for a TFT with SSD1963 controller**

#Description and physical interface#

A Python class for controlling a graphical display with a SSD1963 controller and a 40 PIN interface, which is widely available in the electronics stores. It is a port of the great UTFT driver from Rinky-Dink Electronics, Henning Karlsen. This port uses at least 11 control lines for the 8080-type interface style:

- X1..X8 for data
- Y9 for /Reset
- Y10 for /RD
- Y11 for /WR
- Y12 for C/D

If you only write to the display, RD (Y10) may be left open. Optionally, the follwing lines can be used:

- X3 for LED
- X4 for TFT POWER

CS of the TFT must be tied to GND. A separate supply for the TFT's Vcc should be set up, since it may consume more power than the Pyboard can supply. But it is fine to connect the input of the power regulator to PyBoard Vin, unless the TFT sips more than 1A. Then you can supply the whole unit either through USB or an external power supply at Vin and GND. Before using X3 for LED, check the schematics of the display. In the version I have LED is the enable input of the LED power's step-up converter. But the LED input may be as well the LED power input itself, in which case you have to supply the appropriate current & voltage. If you do not use X3 for LED, connect LED to the 3.3Vcc of the TFT. 
LED may also be controlled by one the SSD1963's GPIO's. But that requires resoldering a resistor on the TFT and changing the setting of the SSD1963.

At the moment, the code is a basic package. I have a two TFTs here, so I cannot test a lot. The actual state is working with a 480x272 and a 800x480 TFT in landscape and portrait mode. There is no principal limitation in size and mode, as long as the 1215k frame buffer of the SSD1963 fits. I just have to figure out how to set the TFT's configuration and make a smooth interface for that.

Since the number of port lines on Pyboard is limited, I use the 8 bit interface. With X1 to x8, these are nicely available at GPIO port A0..A7 in the right order - intentionally, I assume. For speed, the lower level functions are coded as viper or assembler functions. Both variants are supplied. Obviously, the Assembler versions are little bit faster, at the cost of LOC. The total advantage of using assembler may be limited. The assembler functions need 220ns to 260ns to send the three bytes of a display pixel, in contrast to the about 10 µs needed to call this function.
On the upside of this 8 bit interface choice is, that you can supply up to 24 bit of color data, in contrast to the 16 bit when using the 16 bit interface.

In total, the speed is reasonable. Clearing the 480x272 display (= filling it with a fixed color) takes about 30ms. Filling it with varying patterns takes about 40 ms. Reading a 480x272 sized bitmap from a file and showing it takes about 250 to 350ms, depending on the speed of the SD card, the same for a 800x480 bitmap takes 500 to 700ms. Most of that time is needed for reading the file. Drawing a horizontal or vertical line takes about 250µs. Since most of the time is needed for set-up of the function, the length of the line does not really matter. Drawing a single Pixel at a certain coordinate takes 40µs, in contrast to the 250ns/Pixel in bulk transfers, used e.g. by clearSCR() or fillRectangle().

#Class TFT#
##High level functions##
```
Create instance:

mytft = TFT(controller, lcd_type, orientation [, flip_vertical = False][, flip_horizontal = False])
    controller: String with the controller model. At the moment, "SSD1963" is the only 
                one supported
    lct_type: type of LCD. At the moment, "LB04301" (480x272, 4.3") and
              "AT070TN92" (800x480, 7") are supported.
    orientation: which is LANDSCAPE or PORTRAIT
    flip_vertical: Flip vertical True/False
    flip_horizontal: Flip horizontal True/False

Functions:

tft_init(controller, lcd_type, orientation [, flip_vertical = False][, flip_horizontal = False])
    # repeat the initialization which was peformed during creation of the instance.
      This function must be called if the TFT power was switched off, but PyBoard kept
      on running. tft_init is called by __init__() during the creation of the instance.
      It includes the call to power(True), but leaves the backlight off!

getScreensize():
    # return a tuple of logical screen width and height

setColor(FGcolor) 
    # set the foreground color, used by the draw functions
      FGcolor must be a 3-element tuple with the values for red, green and blue.
      range 0..255 each; the lower bits may be ignored

setBGColor(BGcolor) 
    # set the background color, used by clrSCR()
      BGcolor must be a 3-element tuple with the values for red, green and blue.
      range 0..255 each; the lower bits may be ignored

getColor() 
    # get the foreground color, set by a previous setColor call

getBGColor() 
    # get the background color, set by a previous setBGColor call

set_tft_mode([v_flip = False,][ h_flip = False,][ c_flip = False, ][orientation = LANDSCAPE])
    # set the operation mode of the tft, equivalent to the settings used at init time.
    orientation: which is LANDSCAPE or PORTRAIT.
    v_flip: Flip vertical True/False
    h_flip: Flip horizontal True/False
    c_flip: exchange red/blue. This change is effecttive for the whole screen.
    
get_tft_mode()
    # gets the 4 element tuple of v_flip, h_flip, c_flip and orientation

clrSCR()
    # set the total screen to the background color.
    
backlight(percent);
    # Set the LED backlight brightness to percent (0..100). 0 means backlight off. This
    function requires the LED-A pin of the TFT to be connected to Y3.

power(Switch);
    # Switch the power of the TFT on (Switch == True) or off (Switch = False)
      After switching on, the init process has to be repeated

drawPixel(x, y)
    # set a pixel at position x, y with the foreground color

drawLine(x1, y2, x2, y2)
    # draw a line from x1, y1 to x2, y2. If the line is horizontal or vertical, 
      the respective functions are used. Otherwise drawPixel is used. 
      That is where Python gets slow.

drawHLine(x, y, len)
    # draw a horizontal line from x,y of len length

drawVLine(x, y, len)
    # draw a vertical line from x,y of len length

drawRectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    # draw a rectangle from x1, y1, to x2, y2. The width of the line is 1 pixel.

fillRectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2[, color])
    # fill a rectangle from x1, y1, to x2, y2 with the foreground color or with 
      the color given in the optional argument color.

drawClippedRectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    # draw a rectangle with canted edges from x1, y1, to x2, y2. The width of the line is 1 pixel.

fillClippedRectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    # fill a rectangle with canted edges from x1, y1, to x2, y2 with the foreground color.

drawCircle(x, y, radius)
    # draw a circle at x, y with radius diameter. The width of the line is 1 pixel.

fillCircle(x, y, radius)
    # draw a filled circle at x, y with radius diameter.

drawBitmap(x, y, width, height, data, mode)
    # draw a bitmap at location x, y dimension width x height. Data must contain 
      the bitmap data and must be of type bytearray or buffer. Mode tells how
      the data is arranged:
      mode = 0 (default): The data must contain 3 bytes per pixel (red, green, blue), 
          which can for instance created by exporting 24 color-bit raw data files
          with gimp. The total size of data must be width * height * 3. 
      mode = 1: The data must contain 2 bytes per pixel with packed color data 
          (rrrrrggggggbbb) in big endian format (the byte with red first). 
          The total size of data must be width * height * 2.
      No type checking of the data is performed.

setTextPos(x, y[, clip = 0][, scroll = True])
    # Set the starting position for the following calls of
      printString() and printChar() to x, y. x, y is the position of the leftside top pixel 
      of the first character using the font given in font.
      If the value of clip is set and lower than the width of the screen, text will
      be clipped at that absolute position. Th edefault is the screen width.
      scroll tells, whether text will flow over to a next line if longer than the 
      screen width or teh width given by clip. The default is True.
      
getTextPos()
    # return a tuple with the actual x,y values of the text postion for the next char printed

setTextStyle(fgcolor = None [, bgcolor = None][, transparency = 0][, font = dummyfont])
    # Set the Style used for text printing with printChar() and printString()
      If fgcolor is given, that color is used for the characters.
      If bgcolor is given, that color is used for the background for 
      For transparency the following values are valid:
        0: no transparency. The bgcolor is used for char. background, fgcolor for the text
        1: 50% transparency. The previous background is 50% dimmed
        2: full transparency. The previous background is kept.
        4: the existing background will be inverted
        8: for the foreground color, each background pixel value is inverted.
      The foregound settign can be combined with any of the background settings.
      Default are colors set by setColor() and setBGColor(). 
      FGcolor and BGcolor must be triples that can be converted to a 
      bytearray, e.g. tuples, lists or strings.
      The font used must be created e.g. using the GLCD tool and then convert it using
      the cfonts_to_packed_py.py script of Peter Hinch, adapted to the needs of 
      this library.

printString(s [, buffer])
    # print the string s at the location set by setTextPos() in the style 
      detailed by setTextStyle().
      buffer:  is a optional argument for a buffer receiving the background data when
        transparency is chosen. The size must be at least char_with * char_heigth * 3.
        There is no size checking involved. If the buffer is too small, 
        the program will crash. 
      printChar advances the text position for the next text by the width of the
      character. It will flow over to a next line, if necessary, at a distance 
      given by the char height.
      Before printing text, the font must be set with setTextStyle()
      
printChar(c [, buffer])
    # print the character c at the location set by setTextPos() in the style 
      detailed by setTextStyle().
      buffer: is a optional argument for a buffer receiving the background data when
        transparency is chosen. The size must be at least char_with * char_heigth * 3.
        There is no size checking involved. If the buffer is too small, 
        the program will crash. 
      printChar advances the text position for the next text by the width of the
      character. It will flow over to a next line, if necessary, at a distance 
      given by the char height.
      Before printing text, the font must be set with setTextStyle()
      
printNewline()
    # advance the string text position to the next line, where the line height is 
    given by the selected font
    
printCR()
    # set the text position to the start of the line
    
printClrEOL()
    # Clear to the end of the text line by displaying an rectangle with the
    text background color and the height given by the selected font.

setScrollArea(top_fixed_area, vertical_scroll_area, bottom_fixed_area)
    # define the area for line scrolling
    top_fixed_area: Number of lines at the top which is not scrolled
    vertical_scroll_area: Number of lines which will be scrolled
    bottom_fixed_area: Number of lines at the bottom which is not scrolled

setScrollStart(line)
    # set the line which will be the one display first in the vertical scroll area
    line: first logical line displayed
    Screen coordinates are always physical coordinates.

## Lower level functions ##
```
TFT_io.setXY(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    # set the region for the bulk transfer functions fillSCR() and displaySCRxx()
    
clrXY()
    # set the bulk transfer region back to the full screen size
    
TFT_io.fillSCR_AS(data, size)
    # fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel value given
      in data. Size is the number of pixels, data must be a bytearray object
      of three bytes length with the red-green-blue values.
          
TFT_io.displaySCR_AS(data, size)
    # fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel values given
      in data. Size is the number of pixels, data must be a bytearray object
      of 3 * size length with the red-green-blue values per pixel.
    
TFT_io.displaySCR565_AS(data, size)
    # fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel values given
      in data. Size is the number of pixels, data must be a bytearray object
      of 2 * size length with the 16 bit packed red-green-blue values per pixel.
      The color pattern per word is rrrrrggggggbbbbb, with rrrrr in the lower 
      (=first) byte. 
          
TFT_io.displaySCR_bitmap(bits: ptr8, size: int, control: ptr8, bg_buf: ptr8)
    # fill the region set with setXY() or clrXY() with the pixel values given
      in bitmap. Bitmap contains a single bit per pixel in chunks, stasting
      at a Byte boundary. The highest order bit in a byte is the first to be
      displayed. Size is the number of bits the bitmap. Control is a byte vector
      with further parameters controlling the behavior, coded here,
      since viper functions allow 4 arguments only.
      Byte 0..2: Background color, which is used for a bit value of 1
      Byte 3..5: Foreground color, which is used for a bit value of 0
      Byte 6: Transparency mode. See setTextStyle for the value definition
      bg_buf must contain the frame buffer data for the pixel area chose. It is 
      used only when the respective transparency mode is chose. No size checking
      is performed. 
          
TFT_io.tft_cmd_data(cmd, data, size)
TFT_io.tft_cmd_data_AS(cmd, data, size)
    # Send a command byte and data to the controller. cmd is a single integer
      with the command, data a bytearray of size length with the command payload.
      The version with the AS suffix uses inline-assembler.
      During start-up of the tft, when the device is clocked by the 10MHz or 
      6.5 MHz crystal, the assembler version is a little bit too fast.
      Please use the viper version instead.
      This function may also be used for other displays like the Character based
      2x20 or 4x20 displays, which use the 8080-type interface.

TFT_io.tft_cmd(cmd)
    # send a single command byte to the tft.
      
TFT_io.tft_data_AS(cmd, data, size)
    # Send data to the tft. Size is the number of bytes, data must be 
      a bytearray object size length.

TFT_io.tft_read_cmd_data_AS(cmd, data, size)
    # Send a command to the tft and get the response back. cmd is the command byte, 
      data a bytearray of size length which will receive the data.
      
```
#Class TFTfont#
Fonts used by the TFT lib are instances of a class. They are created in two steps:
1. Use GLCD font converter of MicroElectronica [http://www.mikroe.com/glcd-font-creator/](http://www.mikroe.com/glcd-font-creator/) to convert an ttf or otf font into a C data file. Take care to export the C variant. The free version may not allow to store the file directly. Then make use of the option 'copy to Clipboard'. By default, the character values 32 to 127 are converted. You may extend that. There is a bug in the tool when you start at char 0. Then, only the first char will be exported. If you like to include 0, you have to do two steps and combine the output manually.

2.  Use the script cfont_to_packed_py.py to convert the C-file ouput of GLCD into a python script, containing the font class, e.g.
```./cfont_to_packed_py.py font12.c -o font12.py```. If your character set does not start with the space character, you have to add another argument to the creation of the instance, which is the ordinal value of the first char in the font.


The resulting python file can be imported to your code, defining font names, e.g.
```from font12 import font12```
The font class exports two functions:
```
TFTfont(fontbitmap, index, vert, hor, no_of_chars [, first_char=32])
    This creates the instance of the font. Parameters:
    fontbitmap:  the data array with the pixel data
    index: an index array with the offsets of the character bitmaps to the start of the array
    vert: the vertical size of the font in pxels
    hor: the largest horizontal size of the font in pixels. For proportionally spaced fonts 
         this value may differ for every charactes
    no_of_chars: the number of characters defined in this font
    first_char: the ordinal value of the first characted in the font. Default is 32 (Space)
    
get_char(c)
    Return the character bitmap and dimensions. c is the ordinal value of the character. 
    The return value is a tuple comprising of:
    bitmap: The address of a packed bitmap defining character pixels column-by-column. 
            Taken as Python object, this is an int, to be seen by a viper or 
            assembler function as a ptr8 data type.
    vert: The vertical size of the character
    hor:  the horizontal size of the character
    The total number of bits in the character bitmap is n = vert*hor.
    
get_properties()
    Return a tuple with the basi properties of the font. These are:
    bits_vert: the number of vertical pixels
    bits_hor: the largest number of horizontal pixels. For monospaced fonts, this applies to all characters
    nchar: the number of characters in the font set
    firstchar: the ordinal number of the first character in the font set
    
```

#Remarks#
**To Do**
- Scrolling for text.
- Cleaning up the code

**Things beyond the horizon at the moment**
- Try other display sizes than 480x272 and 800x480
- Other Controllers

#Short Version History#

**0.1** Initial Release
Initial release with some basic functions, limited to a 480x272 display in landscape mode and PyBoard. More a proof of feasibilty.

**0.2** Portrait and Landscape mode
Established PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE mode. Added printString(), drawCircle() and fillCircle()

**0.3** Added more functions
- Font widths do not have to be a multiple of 8 any more. 
- Added drawCantedRectangle() and fillCantedrectangle(). 
- Changed the arguments of the constructor to name the controller and lcd type instead of controller and dimensions. The lcd type defines the size, the default orientation and the required initialization code. 
- Provided a dummy font.

**0.4** (no real changes to the TFT class)
- Some explanations on how to determine the LCD settings of the SSD1963 from the LCD data sheet, embedded in the source file.
- The graphic file conversion for displaying as a RGB data bitmap is nicely done by Gimp, the Swiss Army Knife of graphics. Just export the picture as raw data!

**0.5** Split up files
- Split up the class files and the font files
- Some testing and fixing of little bugs
- Changed the byte order in drawBitmap_565(), displaySCR565 and displaySCR565_AS. Now it is consistent to the bmp 65k color file type.

**0.6** Changed to the PCB Layout and Backlight
- added two functions to switch BG LED and power on/off, just to encapsulate these.
- added two variants of the PCB sketches. The 3rd variant uses a pair of transistors to switch the power
on and off, instead of the special power regulator which seems hard to get.
- moved the connection to the touchpad to other ports, such that both UART1 and SPI2 stay available.

**0.7** Changed text printing and font handling completely, with the kind cooperation of Peter Hinch
- changed the text print method, which requires now three functions calls, setTextStyle(), setTextPos() 
and printString() or printChar()
- changed backlight(on/off) to backlight(brightness)
- some minor changes to the interface PCB layout
